# Python-notes
# What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for: web development (server-side), software development, mathematics, system scripting.
What can Python do? Python can be used on a server to create web applications. Python can be used alongside software to create workflows. Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files. Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics. Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

# Why we use Python?
- Python is object-oriented.
Structure supports such concepts as polymorphism, operation overloading and
multiple inheritance.
# Indentation.
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Indentation is one of the greatest feature in python.
# It’s free (open source).
Downloading python and installing python is free and easy.
# It’s Powerful.
-  Dynamic typing
-  Built-in types and tools
-  Library utilities
-  Third party utilities (e.g. Numeric, NumPy, sciPy)
-  Automatic memory management
# It’s Portable
- Python runs virtually every major platform used today
- As long as you have a compaitable python interpreter installed, python
programs will run in exactly the same manner, irrespective of platform.
# It’s easy to use and learn
- No intermediate compile
- Python Programs are compiled automatically to an intermediate form called
byte code, which the interpreter then reads.
- This gives python the development speed of an interpreter without the
performance loss inherent in purely interpreted languages.
- Structure and syntax are pretty intuitive and easy to grasp.
# Interpreted Language
Python is processed at runtime by python Interpreter
# Interactive Programming Language
Users can interact with the python interpreter directly for writing the programs
#  Straight forward syntax
The formation of python syntax is simple and straight forward which also makes it
popular.
